Add UI data feed
	gives attack info, death info, item info, etc.

Make player handle all of its own data

Make method names more descriptive

Make a singular Move() method

Make the bomb attack itself deal damage

FEEDBACK:

Game manager should not do player stuff

Method names should be descriptive and consistent
	Methods should always do and not do any more than what their names say

Watch for duplicate code (only code one Move() method, ...)
